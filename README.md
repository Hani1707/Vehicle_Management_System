# Developed an automated parking barrier system using C on STM32 microcontroller. Integrated the following modules:
- RFID Module: Reads and authenticates card IDs for access control
- Servo Motor: Controls the barrier, opening upon valid authentication
- LCD Display: Provides real-time access status and card ID feedback
- SD Card Module: Logs card IDs, date, and time for each entry event
Performed thorough testing and debugging to ensure reliable hardware-software integration and seamless operation in real-world conditions
# Technology description:
This project involves designing and implementing an Automatic Opening Barrier System for a parking lot. The system uses an RFID reader to detect and authenticate ID cards, enabling secure and efficient entry. When a valid card is presented, the barrier opens, and the system logs the entry details to a micro SD card while displaying information on an LCD screen for easy monitoring  
Techniques and Features Used:
-  PWM.
- Protocol: SPI, I2C
